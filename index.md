                    Kumusta! I’m Hershey Marbeda, an aspiring Software Engineer and Data Scientist. 
                    I was born and raised in the Philippines until my family and I migrated to the U.S. 
                    I have lived in Kentucky, Texas, and Indiana. I believe my experiences in both Metro Manila and the United States will allow me to provide valuable insights on diversity and business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I graduated with an Associate of Science (A.S.) in Computer Science from Ivy Tech Community College in Indianapolis, Indiana, in December 2025. 
                    Currently, I am pursuing an Applied Associate of Science (A.A.S.) in Cybersecurity at the same college, with the intention of graduating in May 2028 or earlier. 
                    This program will enhance my understanding of security. 
                    Additionally, I plan to pursue CompTIA Security+, A+, and Network+ certifications while studying for my A.A.S. in Cybersecurity, which will further strengthen my technical skills and knowledge in the field. 
                    Also, I’m always up for the challenge to upskill and further my education in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy working in web development and data analytics. I created a showcase website for a local rental business in Rizal, Philippines, with the goal of improving its visibility both nationally and globally. 
                    In the future, I plan to develop this showcase website into a full-stack application. 
                    I also hope to apply what I learn from my cybersecurity studies to this project and to future employment opportunities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of school and programming, I enjoy working out and traveling. 
                    My ultimate goal is to work remotely, which will allow me to travel while simultaneously maintaining my work commitments.
